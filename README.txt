USAGE:

In order to use this program, you must drop it into your BL3 save folder. For example, mine is located at:

C:\Users\<my_name>\Documents\My games\Borderlands 3\Saved\SaveGames\701123231\

After doing that, you must create a shortcut file to your Borderlands 3 executable and put it in the same folder. If you are using the Epic Games launcher, you must go and find it in your copy of the Epic Games library. If you are using the Steam version, it should be within the Borderlands 3 folder inside your steam library.

Once you have place the executable and the BL3 shortcut BOTH INSIDE THE SAVE FOLDER YOU WISH TO BACK UP, run the executable. It will back up your saves BEFORE launching the game, then continue to back up the saves every 10 minutes while you play until you close the console window.

I DO NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE. YOU MUST BACK UP YOUR FILES BY HAND BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM TO ENSURE IT DOES NOT DESTROY YOUR SAVE FILES.
